<!-- Place the PNG `Periodic Table of Kubernetes Commands.png` into the `images/` folder. -->
![Periodic Table of Kubernetes Commands](images/Periodic%20Table%20of%20Kubernetes%20Commands.png)

If you don't have the PNG yet, add your image named `Periodic Table of Kubernetes Commands.png` to the `images/` folder (or replace the path above). The image is handy during study; you can also keep the PNG in a GitHub repo open in the exam-allowed GitHub tab.
