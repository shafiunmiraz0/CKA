# Issue scenarios (exam-style)

This folder contains concise, copy/paste-ready scenarios you may encounter on the CKA exam.
Each scenario includes: symptoms, quick diagnostic commands, and one or more fix examples (commands and YAML manifests).

Files in this folder:
- `1-pod-crashloop.md` — Pod CrashLoopBackOff diagnosis & fixes
- `2-service-not-reachable.md` — Service selector / endpoints troubleshooting
- `3-pvc-pending.md` — PVC bound/pending troubleshooting and PV example
- `4-unschedulable-pod.md` — Pod scheduling failures (taints, resources, affinity)
- `5-image-pull-error.md` — ImagePullBackOff and imagePullSecret usage

Use these during practice to rehearse command sequences you can copy during the exam.
